# Arm FF-A ACS Testcase checklist
-----------------------------------------------------

This document presents the mapping of the rules in the FF-A specification to the
test cases and the steps followed in the tests. This also provides the information
about the test coverage scenarios that are implemented in the current release of
ACS and the scenarios that are planned for the future releases.

It could run concurrently on separate PEs in the system.<br>2. In direct messaging, the Receiver could be implemented as a MP endpoint. In this case, the number of execution contexts that the endpoint implements must be equal to the number of PEs in the system. Each execution context must be pinned to a PE at system boot. This enables the SPM or Hypervisor to guarantee availability of an endpoint execution context for direct messages on the same PE as the Sender.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 2.9                               | YES                | Boot execution context setups the secondary execution contexts for VM1 and SP1 endpoints.
